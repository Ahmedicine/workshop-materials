// Here's a fun exercise:
// Part 1: Write a program that asks the user for his name and greets him with his name.
// Here's an example of how the program should run:
//
// Hey buddy! What's your name?
// *user inputs his/her name* 
// Oh wow, *inputted name*! That's such an awesome name. 
//
// Hint: Feel free use some code from read-input.js in order to read user input from the console.
// There's no single correct answer - simply try to find a solution that works!

// Part 2: Feeling ambitious? Modify the program so that it responds differently based on the name entered.
// For example:
//
// Hey buddy! What's your name?
// *user inputs his/her name*
// Oh wow, *name*! That's such an awesome name.

// Hey buddy! What's your name?
// *user inputs his/her name*
// Meh, *name* is an okay name I guess.
